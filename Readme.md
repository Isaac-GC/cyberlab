# CyberLab

---
### Description
Yes, the title of this repo is not super descriptive or named really well... This will be changed later
to have a better name.

**Purpose:** This repo and the code contained within it is to allow for the quick management of enduser learning
and the spinning up of/creation of learning labs. It was/is primarily pointed towards simplicity over fanciness and
is driven to be as efficient as possible. The efficiency is intended to have a fast interface, simplified/straightforward
troubleshooting, and minimal upkeep as possible. 

**Features:**
- No User Username/Password login -> Only login via an issued certificate that is secured on the backend
- Bare minimum User information -> Only first and last name should be used
- No MFA needed. An issued certificate handles the SSO and care is being taken to not use PII
- Creation, Updating, and Management will belong in a simple/straight-forward interface and config files
    - Currently only docker images are supported (Please see future planned features for more info)

---
**Future Planned Features:**
- Investigate and Implement a solution that allows for a wide range of architectures and instances to be used
    - Potential Solutions include Qemu, Nomad, Cloud-Hypervisor, Openstack
- Add in Dark Mode
- Further Secure the lab configuration through using `jailer` or other solutions. Potentially, using firecracker-vm with
    Cloud-Hypervisor should be considered as an alternative too

### Setting up a local version

*Note: It is preferred to be using a *Nix distro for this. For Windows, make sure to use WSLv2.*

0. Clone this repo (but don't enter it or `cd` into it just yet)
1. Ensure that you have Python 3.10 and PIP installed
2. Install virtualenv `pip install virtualenv` (or `pip3 install virtualenv` if you also have python2 still installed)
3. Run `python -m virtualenv cyberlab` ( or `python3 -m virtualenv cyberlab` )
4. Enter the directory -> `cd cyberlab`
5. Run `bin/activate` ( It should enter you in the virtual environment created in step 3)
6. Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Finally, you should run these commands in order (the last command sets up the server)
```python
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
